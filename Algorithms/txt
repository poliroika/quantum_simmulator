At the moment there is:
1 - Deutsch - Joji algorithm
2 - Bernstein - Vasinari algorithm
3 - Quantum Fourier transform
4 - Quantum phase Estimation
5 - Grover 's algorithm(0-2v) (it works if you know the number of iterations, that is, we know the number of solutions, otherwise the wrong answers)
  a - For sat problems
  b - For problems representable in boolean form
6 - Grover 's algorithm(3v) (it works in any case, no matter how many solutions, slower because it uses an additional qubit, explanations inside the file)
  ---
More will be added in the near future!
P.s For some reason, github incorrectly visualizes programs (cuts some blocks)
