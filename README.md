Quantum simulator on Python
Quantum simulator on python, presented in two types. Implementation of some quantum algorithms on each of them. Since this is a personal project, for your own convenience, each of them is registered independently without calling functions from other programs
# Branches:

1. On tensor transformations (One of the most common types of simulators, as it can be accelerated using TPU or using special packages. The main idea is to consider changes in the state vector of a qubit as a vector product per step of a quantum circuit, where the step is the tensor product of its gates [if there is no gate on one of its branches, it is considered as an identical transformation I])
2. Through the sum of binary coefficients()
