At the moment there is:
1 - Deutsch - Joji algorithm
2 - Bernstein - Vasinari algorithm
3 - Quantum Fourier transform
4 - Quantum phase Estimation
5 - Grover 's algorithm
  a - For sat problems
  b - For problems representable in boolean form

More will be added in the near future!
P.s For some reason, github incorrectly visualizes programs (cuts some blocks)
