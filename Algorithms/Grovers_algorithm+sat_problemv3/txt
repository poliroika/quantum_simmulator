The best attempt to make a sat problem on Grover's algorithm
I found what the problem is finally in the sat problem. For a small number of conditions, everything is OK, but the more of them, the more errors and
amplitude windups and averaging in the diffuser in the future, so the more iterations, the more error becomes the correct answer. 
They also write everywhere that the number of Grover iterations should be sqrt (the total number of qubits), but this is only an approximation
that works on small examples, in fact, if you search well, you can understand that only the upper bound estimate is correct, which is different from task 
to task and only its order is needed for practice. Therefore, for large tasks, a dance with a tambourine turns out, on the one hand, starting from the 
upper bound, you must find the optimal number of iterations so that the answer is considered in principle, and on the other hand, try to do the number of 
steps as little as possible, otherwise the error will become the answer.
